              <h3>How We Started</h3>
              <p>At <strong>Home Design Planner</strong>, our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea – to make home design accessible, enjoyable, and stress-free for everyone. It wasn’t just about creating beautiful spaces; it was about helping people feel confident and excited about the places they live in.</p>
          
              <p><strong>The Spark of Inspiration</strong><br>It all started back in <strong>2015</strong> when our founder, <strong>Jona Palacio</strong>, was in the middle of renovating their own home. The process was overwhelming – from finding reliable contractors to deciding on the right layout, to managing the design choices. The experience was frustrating, and there were moments when the vision felt far out of reach. That's when <strong>Jona Palacio</strong> realized something: there was a need for a service that could guide homeowners through the design process in a way that was clear, creative, and efficient.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Turning a Dream into Reality</strong><br>Armed with a passion for interior design and a background in <strong>Architecture, design, project management</strong>, <strong>Jona Palacio</strong> decided to turn that frustration into a solution. They envisioned a service that would help people plan, visualize, and execute their dream spaces without the stress and confusion that often comes with home design.</p>
          
              <p>In <strong>2017</strong>, after months of research, planning, and learning from industry experts, <strong>HOME DESIGN PLANNER</strong> was born. The goal was simple: to empower people to take control of their home design with expert advice, intuitive tools, and a personalized approach that made the entire process easier and more fun.</p>
          
              <p><strong>A Growing Passion</strong><br>From the very beginning, we knew that our business wasn’t just about offering services – it was about building relationships. We started by helping friends and family design their homes, and word quickly spread. Each project, big or small, fueled our passion even more. We realized that what we were really doing was creating spaces that told people’s stories, reflected their personalities, and made them feel truly at home.</p>
          
              <p>As the business grew, we expanded our team of talented designers, project managers, and client coordinators, all sharing the same vision: to make home design an exciting, collaborative journey, not a stressful one. Our team worked tirelessly to refine our services, creating an experience that blends creativity, functionality, and customer care.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Where We Are Today</strong><br>Today, <strong>HOME DESIGN PLANNER</strong> is proud to be a trusted partner for homeowners across <strong>Philippines, Bicol Region-V</strong>. Whether you're remodeling a single room, building from scratch, or simply looking for ideas, our mission remains the same: to make your dream home a reality. We believe that great design is about more than just aesthetics – it’s about creating a space that supports your lifestyle and makes you feel truly at home.</p>
          
              <p>Looking back, it’s amazing to see how far we’ve come from that first renovation. What started as a small idea in the mind of one person has turned into a thriving business that helps people transform their living spaces every day. But even with all our growth and success, we’ve never lost sight of what inspired us in the first place: the belief that home design should be personal, fun, and ultimately, something you feel proud of.</p>
